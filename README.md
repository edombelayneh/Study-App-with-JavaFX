## Objective
This was a solo project. The game uses multithreading to accommodate multiple users playing Rock-Paper-Scissors simultaneously. It can host any number of pairs of players, so with 8 players, it can run 4 games concurrently.

### Skills Learned
- Experience with multithreading for concurrent processing.
- Skill in creating graphical user interfaces with JavaFX.
- Deep understanding of networking and its integration with multithreading.
- Enhanced problem-solving skills in software development scenarios.
- Ability to design and implement interactive applications.
- Experience in debugging and optimizing performance in multithreaded applications.
- Effective integration of user interface elements into software projects.
- Knowledge of client-server architecture and network communication.
